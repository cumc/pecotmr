\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of genotype data where rows represent samples and columns represent genetic variants.}

\item{y}{A vector of phenotype measurements for each sample.}

\item{maf}{A vector of minor allele frequencies for each variant in X.}

\item{susie_fit}{An object returned by the SuSiE function, containing the SuSiE model fit.}

\item{ld_reference_meta_file}{An optional path to a file containing linkage disequilibrium reference data. If provided, variants in X are filtered based on this reference.}

\item{cv_folds}{The number of folds to use for cross-validation. Set to 0 to skip cross-validation.}

\item{X_scalar}{A scalar or vector to scale the genotype data. Defaults to 1 (no scaling).}

\item{y_scalar}{A scalar to scale the phenotype data. Defaults to 1 (no scaling).}

\item{coverage}{The coverage probability used in SuSiE for credible set construction. Defaults to 0.95.}

\item{secondary_coverage}{A vector of secondary coverage probabilities for credible set refinement. Defaults to c(0.7, 0.5).}

\item{signal_cutoff}{A threshold for determining significant signals in the SuSiE output. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{mr_ash_max_iter}{The maximum number of iterations for the MR-ASH method. Defaults to 100.}

\item{min_cv_maf}{The minimum minor allele frequency for variants to be included in cross-validation. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{max_cv_variants}{The maximum number of variants to be included in cross-validation. Defaults to -1 which means no limit.}

\item{cv_seed}{The seed for random number generation in cross-validation. Defaults to 999.}

\item{cv_threads}{The number of threads to use for parallel computation in cross-validation. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A list containing results from the TWAS pipeline, including TWAS weights, predictions, and optionally cross-validation results.
}
\description{
This function performs weights computation for Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS)
incorporating various steps such as filtering variants by linkage disequilibrium reference panel variants,
fitting models using SuSiE and other methods, and calculating TWAS weights and predictions.
Optionally, it can perform cross-validation for TWAS weights.

# Example usage (assuming appropriate objects for X, y, susie_fit, and maf are available):
twas_results <- twas_weights_pipeline(X, y, maf, susie_fit)
