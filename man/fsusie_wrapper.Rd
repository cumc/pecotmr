\title{Wrapper for fsusie Function with Automatic Post-Processing

This function serves as a wrapper for the fsusie function, facilitating
automatic post-processing such as removing dummy credible sets (cs) that don't meet
the minimum purity threshold and calculating correlations for the remaining cs.
The function parameters are identical to those of the susiF function.}
\usage{
fsusie_wrapper(
  X,
  Y,
  pos,
  L,
  prior,
  max_SNP_EM,
  cov_lev,
  min.purity,
  max_scale,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Residual genotype matrix.}

\item{Y}{Response phenotype matrix.}

\item{pos}{Genomics position of phenotypes, used for specifying the wavelet model.}

\item{L}{The maximum number of the credible set.}

\item{prior}{method to generate the prior.}

\item{max_SNP_EM}{maximum number of SNP used for learning the prior.}

\item{cov_lev}{Coverage level for the credible sets.}

\item{min.purity}{Minimum purity threshold for credible sets to be retained.}

\item{max_scale}{numeric, define the maximum of wavelet coefficients used in the analysis (2^max_scale).
Set 10 true by default.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the fsusie function.}
}
\value{
A modified fsusie object with the susie sets list, correlations for cs, alpha as df like susie,
        and without the dummy cs that do not meet the minimum purity requirement.
